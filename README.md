# Movie-Rating-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-
Developed a movie rating prediction model using ensemble learning with a voting classifier. Implemented algorithms including Gradient Boosting, KNN, Extra Trees, and Random Forest. Achieved maximum accuracy through the ensemble learning approach via voting classifier.

The movie dataset we used includes films released after the year
2000. To ensure the reliability of our data, we filtered the dataset
to include only movies that had at least 10,000 raters and a
minimum budget of 10,000 USD. This filtering was essential to
eliminate newer movies with insufficient ratings and very low-
budget movies that could skew the accuracy of our predictions. By
setting these criteria, we aimed to focus on well-established movies
that would provide a more stable basis for our machine learning
models
